Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) 
is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined 
categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. </br>

In this repository we train a simple GRU based recurrent nueral network for Part-Of-Speech application from scratch, achieving good results even with a small network.
