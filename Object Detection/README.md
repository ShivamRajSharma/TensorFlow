# Object Detection 
 
 Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. In this repoistory various techniques that can be used for Object Detection.
 ## 1) Face Detection from Scratch
 
 We use a pretrained MobileNetV2 model as our base model and fine tune its last layers for the face detection. We use faces class of the [PASCAL-VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) to train our network. The results of Face Detection are available inside the notebook.
 
 2) Multiclass Object detection from Scratch
 3) Turning a image classifier into Object Detection
